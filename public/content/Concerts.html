<p>
Commissioned by the Smart Museum for the opening of their exhibition Solidary & Solitary, which explored abstraction as a political focus. While the exhibition focused on black artists from the 1940s to the present, we found two poems by Langston Hughes: "The Cross,"  and "Dream Variations" analysis of dreams, death, and intersectionality to capture the spirit of the exhibition.
